            and my journey from a small village in Gaura, Sitamarhi, to the
            world of tech has been nothing short of an adventure. Growing up in
            a close-knit community, I always felt a strong pull towards
            exploring new ideas and solving problems. My curiosity and passion
            led me to pursue a B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering at
            Maharishi Markandeshwar (Deemed to be University), where I’ve been
            able to turn my dreams into reality.

            where every sunrise brings new possibilities. That’s where my story
            began. With a thirst for knowledge and a drive to make something of
            myself, I worked hard to excel in my studies, achieving 75% in 10th
            grade and 76% in 12th grade. These accomplishments set the stage for
            my adventure into the world of technology.

            I immersed myself in coding and development. From building
            full-stack applications like the Airbnb Full Stack Project to
            creating practical tools like the Axis Bank Passbook Printing
            Software, I’ve loved every challenge along the way. My internship at
            Codesoft Technology was a pivotal moment, where I honed my skills in
            C++ and learned how to tackle real-world tech problems.
